# User research tracking tool for behavioral analysis

## Concept

###### What is it?
API written on Javascript.
###### Where is it used?
Javascript based prototypes.
###### Whom does it address?
Primarily UX Designers, UX Researchers, UX Prototypers.
###### Who will apply it?
Mainly UX Prototypers.
###### What is it used for?
For tracking the logs during a usability test session. By completing each usability test session, the script generates a file that is a detailed list of all user's interactions. This list can then be consumed in order to visualise the data and create comparable graphics.
###### What is the idea behind it?
To evaluate quicker prototypes. Under the allowance of the users, easily keep a detailed track of their actions that can be directly extracted and compared among all the usability sessions, in order to quickly evaluate the prototype.
###### What is the purpose of it?
To test and evaluate new interaction and design concepts before going to production.
###### What is the technical approach?
Independent from the JS framework used into the prototype.
###### How to take advantage of it?
Boost the prototype evaluation by its instant output.
* Compare the tracks between users to calculate average values.
* Compare the tracks with the expected values to calculate divergence.
* Compare the tracks of same user to interpret behavior.
