An OpenUI5 based prototype that demonstrates the [user research tracking tool for behavioral analysis](https://github.com/SAP/ux-tracking-tool).

__[UPDATE]__ The tool has been accepted as open source project and is now included in SAP's public Github organisation. Please, find the prototype [here](https://github.com/ux-teckel/openui5-tool-landscape-prototype). Therefore, this repository has been deprecated.

---

Open the [prototype](https://ux-teckel.github.io/openui5-tool-landscape-prototype/) in your browser and enable the console from the developer tools. The tool will have been talking to you! :)
Check the use case related content of the ```UseCaseData.json``` [file](https://github.com/ux-teckel/openui5-tool-landscape-prototype/blob/master/UseCaseData.json), and follow the steps described on the prototype. By the end of the flow, a CSV file will be generated.
